INTEGRALS: ANALYTICAL VS NUMERICAL APPROXIMATION:
Integrating the polynomials analytical requires an integration by parts method and
also requires a parsing language to handle the expressions to integrate. I have 
therefore deemed it unwise to proceed with this idea. Instead I will solve the
integrals by using Riemann sum.

Ran into a problem using partition variable when handing out the partitions two the 
polynomials in the polynomialList. Found out it is better to only use a deltaX, therefore
not needing to specify a partition number. The partition number also varied with the total
length L, thus deltaX was a better fit overall.  


OVERVIEW:
Main starts up and given initial values and parameters, asks HeatEuqtionSimulation to create a solution
which is put inside a GraphHeat object.
This object is then given to the Drawer class that creates a windows and a MainPanel to
visualize everything on. The MainPanel communicates with the Graph when the simulation is running.

SPLINE IMPLEMENTATION:
1. 	Get a list containing the points. TODO: Make sure the list is in order, order them
	by ordering the x value, i.e. (1,3), (2,1), (5,6), (9,1).

2.	Between each point, calculate the derivative from point i to point i+1. Also calculate
	the derivative from point i+1 to i+2.
	
3.	Create a cubic hermite interpolation spline from point i to i+1.
	The restrictions of the polynomial p_i are:
		- 	p_i(x_i) = y_i
		-	p_i(x_(i+1)) = y_(i+1)
		- 	p'_i(x_i) = slope from point i to point i+1
		-	p'_i(x_(i+1)) = slope from point i+1 to i+2
		
	Given N points, when at point k = N-1 there are no k+2 point to calculate the derivative
	from point k+1 to k+2. Therefore, check if we are at point N-1. If it is true, calculate
	the derivative from point k+1 to k instead. When coding this, make sure the signs are correct.

NOTE ABOUT WAVE DAMPING EQUATION:
It is not the true mathematical equation for damping. I have simply copied the e term from
heat equation and multiplied it with the wave equation, thus only simulating the damping effect
for the wave equation.
